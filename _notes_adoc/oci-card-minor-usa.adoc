== Intro

=== What this is?

Presumably, you are here because you are looking for some clarity in the midst of the complicated, even somewhat tortuous footnote:disclaimers[truly, a brilliant equivalent of a citizenship test and an introduction to Indian bureacracy], process of applying for an OCI card for your child (US minor). I've been through this experience and this document is my attempt to make this less painful for you.

=== What this is not?

This is not intended to be an offical guide to the process of applying for an OCI card. The https://www.in.ckgs.us/oci/how-to-apply[official website is here]. You are responsible for double checking any information presented here.

=== Do you really need an OCI card for your child?

For visits to India up to 6 months, you have two alternative options

. E-visa / eTourist Visa

+
a very easy process https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html[online]
. https://www.in.ckgs.us/visa/tourist-visa[Tourist visa] 
+      
stay for https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/visa/general-visa-questions/487/what-is-the-duration-and-validity-of-a-tourist-visa#487[6 months] at a time, valid for 5 yearsfootnote:disclaimers[5 years for minors, 10 years in general, according to the CKGS website] 

Both of these are easier to apply for than OCI cards.


== Application process: high level 

Here's the high level picture.

. Start at the CKGS website, get a temporary id, fill some forms and pay the fees.

. Next, go to the the Govt of India OCI website, fill some more forms and upload copies of some documents. At the end, get an application id and an OCI application form (PDF) that will be all filled out for you.

. Bring the Govt of India application id back to CKGS and tie it in with the previous CKGS temporary id. The CKGS website will then present a checklist of documents to assemble (including the original passport and the Govt of India OCI form from Step 2). 

. Send these documents over to CKGS 

. Get back the original passport from CKGS within around 2 weeks(?)

. Get the OCI card within around 3 months(?)

. Start by filling out the forms at https://www.in.ckgs.us/oci/ 


. During this process, you will get a temporary id called a *Web Reference Number*. You can use this to resume the series of forms in Step 1 (as you can guess, a different "temporary id" will be presented to you in Step 2).

. At a certain point, you will be presented with a gigantic document checklist that will make no sense at this point footnote:disclaimers[I can only imagine they show this giant list right in the beginning for no reason other than to check if you have the mental strength to become an OCI card holder]. Save this checklist because you will need it later.

. You will be asked if you want to drop off the final forms personally or ship them to CKGS. I would recommend dropping them off in person footnote:disclaimers[dropping them off reduces the chance of snafus in the process and increases the chance that you talk to a real person that may clarify some of the inevitable doubts you will have]. If that is not possible, choose to pay CKGS for all shipping costs (Fedex was the carrier I used)

. Pay CKGS for all fees involved

. At this point, CKGS will send you over to the Govt Of India website with a bunch of instructions. Welcome to Step 2.

== Govt of India website: fill out some more forms

https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/oci/government-website-questions/1000/how-do-i-fill-the-government-form#1000[Useful resource to consult]

. Make sure you have the files ready to upload in this step
.. Passport photo 
+
JPG Max 200 KB, https://www.in.ckgs.us/faq/oci/photo-and-signature-specifications/836/what-are-the-oci-photo-specifications-for-minors#836[more specifications here].

.. Thumb impression of the child

Left thumb for boys, right thumb for girls.footnote:disclaimers[Left for boys, right for girls? In case you forgot that you were dealing with Indian bureacracy, this clause right here should jolt you into attention]
+
I got https://www.joann.com/hampton-arts-washable-ink-pad/xprd77670.html[this stamp pad] to take the fingerprint.

.. Child's passport
.. Child's birth certificate
.. Whatever documents show Proof of Indian origin : parents' passports if you are Indian citizens, otherwise consult the checklist. 
.. I did not upload a marriage certificate here because I assumed that was for spouse-based-OCI.

. When you start filling out the forms, you will get a "temporary id" (different from the CKGS one). You can use this to resume saved forms. But at some point, you will get a new *File Reference Number*. If you want to resume uploading docs/images, you need this number, not the "temporary id".
+
Note this *File Reference Number* carefully, because this is what will tie in to the CKGS website later.
. You will also get a filled OCI application form at the end, which will be part of the final packet you send to CKGS.


== Return to CKGS website, assembling the packet

. You now need to link the two parts together footnote:disclaimer[this puzzle is part of the subtle mental aptitude test inherent in the OCI application process]. 
. Go the CKGS home page, and look for the "Link Govt Reference Number with CKGS .." section, follow the instructions.
. CKGS should now present you with a full checklist of documents that need to be assembled footnote:disclaimers[The checklist document itself is part of the checklist. Some say Christopher Nolan got the idea for Inception while applying for an OCI card.]
. Some notes about these documents
.. Original passport. CKGS is supposed to ship this back to you after verification (without waiting for the full OCI card processing).
.. The birth certificate here needs to be http://www.internationalapostille.com/what-is-an-apostille/[apostilled]. Not simply notarized, but attested to be original by the Secretary of State him/herself. This is usually a lengthy process that involves mailing your documents to the state capital. Sometimes, you can find https://www.yelp.com/biz/4-notary-and-29-apostille-service-sunnyvale-3?q=apostille[intermediaries] to help you. 
+
Unlike a notary, the apostille process typically involves adding a certification sheet on top of the original certificate (this may vary from state to state). So this means you are going to have to send in the original birth certificate to CKGS footnote:disclaimers[if the prospect of mailing additional original documents to CKGS excites you, you are the right candidate for an OCI card.]. https://www.immihelp.com/forum/india-passport-visa-oci/184436-apostilled-birth-certificate?p=582917#post582917[This post] may help you.
.. A couple of documents need to be notarized (parental auth form and affidavit in lieu of originals).
.. Legal status of parents in US - I included copies of our visa stamps, though technically the I-94 might be a more appropriate document footnote:disclaimers[Why does the Govt of *India* care about my *US* visa status in order to issue an OCI card for my child, you may wonder? Keep wondering, because I have no clue.]
